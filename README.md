# How to Use This

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that both python and npm are installed
- Optionally, you may want to use a fresh virtual environment

## Run the Application

- Run this command in its own terminal to run the unit tests and backend locally (you may need to use "python3" instead of "python" depending on your device)

```sh 
python run_backend.py
```

- Next, open a new terminal and run this command to start the frontend

```sh
python run_frontend.py
```

- Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to use the application
- Lastly, run the E2E tests by running this command

```sh
python run_e2e.py
```

- In the new window, select E2E testing
- Select any browser and click "Start E2E Testing"
- In the new browser window, click the "spec.cy.ts" file and watch the tests automatically run
